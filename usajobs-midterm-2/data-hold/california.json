How would you like to become a part of a team providing compassionate care to Veterans? The Department of Veterans Affairs(VA) needs employees who possess the energy, compassion, and commitment to serve those who served our Country. The VA Travel Nurse Corps Program (TNC), a constituent of the Veterans Health Administration Interim Staffing Program (ISP), is comprised of a VA operated internal pool of Registered Nurses available for temporary short term assignments at VA Medical Centers throughout the country. The goals of the program are to maintain high standards of patient care quality and safety; reduce the use of outside supplemental staffing; improve recruitment of new nurses into the VA system; improve retention by decreasing turnover of newly recruited nurses; support the delivery of VA health care in rural or underserved areas; provide alternatives for experienced nurses considering leaving the VA system; and to establish a potential pool of Registered Nurses for national emergency preparedness efforts. TNC RNs will be assigned to interested facilities throughout VHA. Assignment lengths will be flexible to meet facilities' varying needs. RNs selected for the program will be appointed as temporary intermittent nurses. These intermittent nurses will be paid for the time they work, and receive travel, lodging, meals and incidental expenses competitive with the private sector and in accordance with VA regulations. Nurses new to VA will receive training on the special needs of Veterans, VA procedures and policies, the computerized patient record system, bar coded medication administration, and the VA Health Care System in general. The VA has adopted Core Values and Characteristics that apply universally across the Department. The five Core Values define \"who we are,\" our culture, and how we care for Veterans, their families and other beneficiaries. The Values are I ntegrity, C ommitment, A dvocacy, R espect and E xcellence (\" I CARE \"). America's Veterans need you! To find out more, go to http://www.va.gov/jobs/ . VA encourages persons with disabilities to apply. The health related positions in VA are covered by Title 38, and are not covered by the Schedule A excepted appointment authority."

To ensure that you receive consideration, applications submitted through the on-line application process must be received by 11:59 p.m. eastern time the day before a certificate of candidates is issued.
